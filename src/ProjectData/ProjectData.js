        projectDescription: "SpudBud is a children's adventure game involving a traveling potato. It is designed to help children learn context clues by matching appropriate items to a specific location. You can enter your name to create a user account in my database and then from there you will be provided a random location and a randomized list of items. You need to correctly match what the potato needs to pack for that location. For example, if the potato is going to school it might need a backpack, notebook, and pencil. If the correct items are selected your Spudbud will teleport to that location with the correct items. You can also save all the places you have been to with your specific username.",

        projectDescription: "Campanion is a camping journal I created to keep information about different off-grid campsites I like to visit.  Users can log in to see their campsites as well as create new campsites by entering basic information like a title, picture, and coordinates.  When searching or filtering through your campsites, you can click on them and see a more detailed view.  I connected to weatherbit.io's API to show you the current weather for that location.  I also connected to google maps API to show your location on a map as well as provide directions.",
